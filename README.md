### FYI
Custom GCC 12.2.1 `(xea-xo1-gcc)` + Binutils 2.39, Baremetal with `gmp v6.2.1`, `mpfr v4.1.0`, `mpc v1.2.1`.
This is gcc latest rolling release with branch `releases/gcc-12`

### Why Gitlab?
Because `Github` can't accommodate 1 file that is more than `100MB`

### Why Use Custom GCC?
A lot of questions like this get asked. Isn't it like `why do we have to bake a cake when we just can buy it o in shops`. Yes you are right, but `will you be satisfied with the cake every time you buy it? Don't you want to try making the cake yourself? Wouldn't it be boring to eat the same bread every time? Won't there be something new? Why use a custom gcc while the default gcc from our system already exists? Does default gcc complete with custom gcc same.` The answer is `No` why?  yes because the default gcc normally does not have additional packages. In the contents of the file also gcc custom is more varied and has several flags/tags that can make the gcc can be modified as much as possible

### What is the point of the above paragraph?
From here we can conclude, there will be differences in taste, topping, and tenderness in our own cakes. because it will adjust to the taste you like. and we can customize custom gcc according to the wishes of the maker
